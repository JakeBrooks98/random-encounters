<h2><b>Reflection</b></h2>

 RandomEncounters is a front end capstone I have developed while working at Nashville Software School. This app was designed to work with tools inspired by 5e Dungeons and Dragons to help Game Masters to be able to quickly throw together encounters at the last minute. Originally this was going to be mostly a choose your own adventure style application with users able to create their own encounters and view them in a list with all other user encounters, but through stretch goals each encounter can now provide a 5e Dungeons and Dragons statblock for monsters added to the encounter using the Dnd 5e API and it also has the potential to randomize encounters. The Random encounters can be filtered out using drop down menus.
